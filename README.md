>   ##### 1.  Africa is the one has the highest average monthly income compared to others regions such as South America, or Norrth America.  Maybe, the number of  high income countries in this region emerge  more frequently than low income counties, which is believed to lead to the explosion in average income of this region.
>   ##### 2.  Generally, income of regions is fluctuated, even it shows a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2023. Maybe, because  nowadays, it's harder to find a job, or people have to pay more taxes.
